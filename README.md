Amoveo is a blockchain meant for enforcement of investment and insurance contracts.


Amoveo contracts are enforced using state-channels. This means fees are low, contracts are nearly instant and can support a global audience.

Amoveo has oracle technology.
Amoveo can learn facts about our world and enforce the outcome of contracts that are governed by these facts.
This, for example, enables you to bet on the price of Amazon shares.

The variables that define how to participate in Amoveo can be modified by the Amoveo community using a built-in process.
This way Amoveo will always stay optimally tuned to produce the best results.

## Light node
Simply visit [this webpage](http://159.65.120.84:8080/wallet.html) to participate in Amoveo, no installation necessary.

You can also download the javascript light node to ensure you have the secure version, and to be able to run in cold storage. To use the javascript light node start amoveo with `make prod-go` and visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/wallet.html`

This light node downloads headers and verifies the proof of work.
It verifies the merkle proofs for all blockchain state you download to ensure security equivalent to a full node, provided you wait for enough confirmations.
You can use the light node to participate in [markets](docs/light_node/market.md).
A light node that currently has markets is [here](http://159.89.106.253:8080/wallet.html).
And the interface to look at the markets is [here](http://159.89.106.253:8080/explorer.html).

## Exchanges

this is an escrow tool from Zack who wrote Amoveo: http://159.89.106.253:8087/main.html
Be very careful using exchanges. They are centralized, the operator can take all the veo if they wanted.


## Block Explorer

The block explorer for the network is [here](http://159.65.120.84:8080/explorer.html).

Another explorer is [here](http://159.89.106.253:8080/explorer.html). This one has some markets where you can gamble.

## Full node
[Launch an erlang full node and connect to the network](docs/getting-started/turn_it_on.md)

[Issue commands to your full node](docs/api/commands.md)
Commands such as:
* turning the node off without corrupting the database.
* looking up information from the blockchain or it's history.
* making a server that collects fees by routing payments or making markets
* participating in the oracle mechanism or governance mechanism.

## Mining

[This is an open-source miner for AMD and Nvidia GPU. Currently only works with Linux](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/VeoCL)

[Here is an open-source miner for Nvidia GPU, it works for linux and windows](https://github.com/Mandelhoff/AmoveoMinerGpuCuda)

[This is a miner. it is for Nvidia or AMD GPUs. It is closed-source.](https://github.com/PhamHuong92/VeoMiner)

[here is another closed source miner](https://github.com/krypdkat/AmoveoMinerMan)

Amoveo's mining algorithm uses SHA256 like bitcoin. But it is a little different, so bitcoin ASICs cannot be used to mine Amoveo.

Full node keys are stored in `_build/prod/rel/amoveo_core/keys/keys.db`

## Software to launch a new mining pool
If your full node is on a different machine from your miner, you will need a mining pool. [Mining pool software can be found here.](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo-mining-pool)
The "master" branch is for paying out small amounts to each miner with each block.
The "classic" version only pays a miner when they find a block.
