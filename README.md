## Light node
Simply visit [this webpage](http://146.185.142.103:8080/wallet.html) to participate in Amoveo, no installation necessary.
This light node downloads headers and verifies the proof of work.
It verifies merkle proof of all blockchain state you download to give as much security as a full node, if you wait enough confirmations.
You can mine slowly mine blocks from the light node.


## Block Explorer
The block explorer for the network is [here](http://146.185.142.103:8080/explorer.html)
Go to the block explorer to see all the markets that are being run on that node.


## Full node
[Launch an erlang full node and connect to the network](docs/getting-started/turn_it_on.md)


## Mining
[Here is the best mining software that works with Amoveo](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo-c-miner)
It uses SHA256 like bitcoin. But it is a little different, so bitcoin ASICs cannot be used to mine Amoveo.
