Futarchy Spending
============


If we have a bunch of money owned collectively by a community, can we use some kind of futarchy mechanism to decide how to spend it?



I suspect that it is an impossible goal.
because there can be any number of choices for what we can spend the money on.
but the money in any bet can only count for 1 choice at a time.
so instead of thinking "what is the best choice", betters will think about "Which choices are most electable, and out of those, which is the lesser evil?"
