Science of Blockchain
================

If you want to be a profitable investor in blockchain mechanisms, you should learn to tell the difference between a valid scientific experiment that can lead to more powerful mechanisms, and superstitious rituals that will waste many resources.

Science is a popular technique for learning things that have never been known before. How can we use science to find out how to build better blockchain mechanisms?
The answer is important for the people who design blockchains, scientific experimentation can give us the information we need to build better blockchain mechanisms.

Science is a process where you come up with possible explanations for the phenomena we observe around us, called hypothesis, and then we do experiments to try and disprove our hypothesis. 

A limitation of science is that you need to be able to control every variable which can influence the outcome of your experiment, that way you can precisely measure the effect of what you care about. In game theory, economics, and blockchain, the basic actors are intelligent humans who can learn and adapt to their changing environment. An experiment that can conclusively show X behavior about people when exposed to a mechanism in 2019, could fail to show X in 2025, once people have learned the tricks for exploiting the mechanism. The fact that a mechanism functioned in the past doesn't tell you very much about whether it will function in the future.

So, if we can't depend on science or history to guide us, how are we supposed to build or invest in new mechanisms?
We can get science working again by focusing on the subset of mechanisms where people's strategy wont change, even if their culture and skills do change. This is how we can control all the initial conditions, so that results from experiments today will be applicable for the future.

Using math, we can show whether a given mechanism is of the kind where the user's strategy wont change, even if their culture and skills change. We do this by showing that the default strategy is the one and only nash equilibrium strategy of the game. Which basically means that no one ever has an incentive to deviate from the default strategy.

Once we know that any deviations are less profitable vs the default strategy, then we also know that changes in culture or skills will not cause changes in the behaviour of the participants, because there is nothing left to learn that can give you an advantage in this mechanism.


So, if anyone tells you about an "experiment on the blockchain", there is a way that you can know if they are doing a scientific experiment that could result in a profitable new product, or if they are doing a superstitious media stunt. Find out if they have proven that their proposed mechanism has this property: it is not possible to profit by deviating from the default strategy in the mechanism. If this proof does not exist, then it is not a scientific experiment that could be used to learn about blockchain. It is a media stunt to get attention and raise money.
