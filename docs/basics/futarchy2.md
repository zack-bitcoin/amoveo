Markets reveal information for free, as a side effect.
Through the price
We can construct financial assets very carefully, such that the price of the asset in a market reveals any information that could interest us.
For example, one of Obama's campaign promises was that he would close Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and stop torturing people. He promised to do this his first month as president.

This was a lie.

We could have made some financial markets so that insiders who knew that Obama was lying could trade on their insider information to profit, and the market would reveal to us that Obama has no intention of ending the torture.
P = obama is elected
Q = guantanamo bay is closed by date X

we could have 4 markets:
P and Q
!P and Q
P and !Q
!P and !Q

Then by looking at the prices in the markets, we could know if Obama is lying.
