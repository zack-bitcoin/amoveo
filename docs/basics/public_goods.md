Public Goods
=========

A public good is some resource that is available to more than one person, and we don't have to pay to use it.
For example, open source software is available to everyone who wants to use it, and doesn't cost anything.

Efficiently funding public goods
==========

Let V be the total value of a public good to all the people who use it.
Let C be the total cost to produce the public good.

If V>C, then creating the public good is a benefit to humanity.

Historically we have defined the efficiency of a mechanism for producing public goods based on how high the value C/V can get, and the mechanism still successfully produces the good. Which means a perfectly efficient mechanism for creating public goods should work in any case where V>C.

This is not a good way of modeling efficiency. As Vitalik explains in https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/04/03/collusion.html

"there is an impossible tradeoff between either failing to incentivize legitimate public goods or over-subsidizing plutocracy."

So the goal of funding public goods where V/C ~= 1, it is an impossible goal.

Capital is finite
========

Humanity has finite access to capital that could be used to fund public good production.
There are finitely many projects that we could possibly be working on simultaniously.

Capacity for improvement is infinite
========

The number of possible public good projects that we could possibly work on is infinite.
Even if we restrict ourselves to only public good projects where V>C, the space of possibilities is still effectively infinite.

A better model
========

Given that we have finite capital to spend, and infinite possible public goods we could spend it on, we should try to identify which public goods projects can product the most value for the least cost.
Let us sort the possible public goods projects we could work on by decreasing value of V/C.
We should focus on only funding those projects which are at the very beginning of this list, because those are the projects which will allow us to produce more value for less effort.

If we restrict ourselves to only working on public goods where V/C > 10, we still probably do not have enough capital to fund all of these projects.

Benefits of the better model
========

Using this better model, we are able to fund the creation of all the public goods that we would want.
