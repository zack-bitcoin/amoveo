#### Why use Prediction Markets?
Prediction Markets are tools for efficiently getting information about the future from groups of people.
Prediction Markets are best used in situations were there is a lot of money at stake, so people are spreading propaganda, or lying to each other, making it hard to find out accurate information.
You use prediction markets to find out probabilistic information about the future.

#### What are Prediction Markets?
Using prediction markets means making a betting market, and we learn information by looking at the prices at which people are betting.
If people are betting at 3:1 odds that team B will win in football, that means there is about a 75% chance that team B will win.

#### Why not use Prediction Markets?
Prediction Markets are slow, and it is difficult to get more than a few bits of information at a time.
You can only ask about information that will eventually become common knowledge.

### Futarchy
Futarchy means using prediction markets to find out information that is used to make decisions for groups of people.
