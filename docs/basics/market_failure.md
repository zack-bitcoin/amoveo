Market Failure
========

in a market failure, the cost to do a bribe and control the decision being made is on the order of about (value being decided over)/(number of voters)

market failures happen if the rational strategy for individuals is not the same as the rational strategy for the group.

voting mechanisms suffer from market failure if there is bribery. you can see from a 2x2 chart.
Example: we are voting on A or B. if A wins, then every voter is $100 richer. There are 100 voters with equal stake.
I bribe all the voters $2 to vote for B

```
Wins:    A    B
vote A: $100 $0
vote B: $102 $2
```

you can see form the chart that any individual voter would prefer to vote for B. because 102 > 100, and 2 > 0.
So $200 of bribes can destroy $10 000 of value.
