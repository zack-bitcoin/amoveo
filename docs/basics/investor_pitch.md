Investor Pitch
==========

## What do you do?

Amoveo is a tool for enforcing arbitrary bets. It uses blockchain technology to avoid depending on any trusted intermediary.
Betting is a basic tool of finance that can be used to hedge risks.
When people bet in markets, the prices of those markets can reveal important information. A carefully crafted bet can enable a market to reveal any information known to mankind, to the most accurate degree possible. Amoveo allows us to program arbitrary bets, so we can make markets to reveal any information.
We can use the prices in these markets to make better decisions than are possible with existing decision mechanisms: like boards of directors, or voting, or putting someone in charge.

## How far along are you?

Amoveo has been live for over a year, there has been a lot of experimentation, but we have not achieved product market fit yet.
The blockchain itself is finished. We have written a fast version called a "light node" in javascript that only downloads a few megabytes of data, but is as secure as the full version. Approximately hundreds of people are using the light node to store and spend their veo, but only about a dozen have used it to make bets.

## How big is the market?

The technical name for "betting", in the context of finance, is "financial derivatives".
The global market for financial derivatives is measured in the trillions of dollars. Amoveo reduces costs and legal friction of using these type of contracts, so we expect that this will make the market grow much bigger.
I encourage you to do a google search to find out how big the financial derivatives market could be.

## How will you charge users?

There is a limited supply of the VEO coins. New VEO can only be created by spending a similar amount of money on electricity and hardware.
You need VEO coins to make bets on Amoveo.
So the cost of using Amoveo is in buying the VEO coins to be able to use it.

## What do you know that others don't?

We know that it is possible to have a secure oracle system, while only locking up a tiny fraction of the amount that our competitors need to.
Launching an oracle on Amoveo involves locking up about $1 of VEO, it doesn't matter how much money is being bet in that oracle.
Most of our competitors, if for example they wanted to allow $1000 of betting in a market, they would need to lock up $1000 or more of money inside the oracle to facilitate this.

This is possible because Amoveo combines the POW mining mechanism with the oracle mechanism in a way that can not be done on Ethereum, or any platform used by our competitors.
Amoveo was designed from day one for financial derivatives, so all the different pieces are optimized for this goal.


## Who is on your team?

* Zack Hess - blockchain and game theory specialist. He maintains and writes the core Amoveo software, and many related tools. He knows how to prove what can work, and what will break. https://github.com/zack-bitcoin
* Mr Flintstone - betting expert. He comes up with the ideas to make sure our product is as useful as can be.
* Sy - Sy operates veopool, which is a mining pool. A mining pool is where people can use GPU and FPGA to create new VEO. Sy wrote and maintains http://explorer.veopool.pw/index.php . He often has ideas for how to make Amoveo easier for 3rd parties to build on top of.
* Potato - Potato operates Amoveopool, which is another mining pool.
* Exan.tech - Company of many talented people. They run amoveo.io , and they created and maintain the iphone and android apps of Amoveo. They write blog posts about Amoveo. 
* Eric Arsenault - UX designer with a background in betting technology. He is using Amoveo contracts to raise money to fund the development of a better UX experience.
* Catweed - wrote and maintains https://veoscan.io/ a popular explorer for Amoveo.
* Qtrade.io and a1.exchange - these are places where you can trade BTC for VEO. They work together with us to make sure software updates happen smoothly without impacting the trader's experience.
* Various people who write and maintain mining software for different GPU and FPGA hardware. The diversity of mining software helps maintain the diversity in who owns VEO. 

None in this list employs any other on the list. There is no hierarchy in Amoveo.
We are a team in the sense that we work together and share common goals.
