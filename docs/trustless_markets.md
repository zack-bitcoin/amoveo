Trustless markets in financial derivatives are the goal of this software.
It is not a generic smart contract platform like Ethereum.

By financial derivative, I mean a bet that is priced in the native tokens (AE for aeternity). The money at being gambled is locked up until the winner is known. Neither participant in the bet has to trust the other.

These markets need to be scalable so that many people can participate. That is why they will exist off-chain on the channels.
