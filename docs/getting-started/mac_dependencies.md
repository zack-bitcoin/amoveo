install erlang version 18 or higher.
You may need to install from source http://www.erlang.org/downloads

Or use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
```
brew install erlang
```

It depends on sed, the stream editor
```
brew install gnu-sed --with-default-names
```

Use git to download the software, then go into the testnet directory
```
git clone https://github.com/aeternity/testnet.git
cd testnet
```
