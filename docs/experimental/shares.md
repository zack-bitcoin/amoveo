There are many kinds of shares.
Every kind of share can be found in 2 forms, positive and negative.
If you own positive shares of form X, and receive negative shares of the same form, they cancel out and become normal AE tokens.
Similarly, AE tokens can be transformed into equal amounts of positive and negative forms of the same share.
Each kind of share has the same difficulty written on it.

Positive shares are more valuable when the blockchain's difficulty is expected to stay above the difficulty written on the share.
Negative shares are more valuable when the blockchain's difficulty is expected to stay below the difficulty written on the share.

All shares have a half-life. They are either disappearing, or converting into AE tokens.
If the difficulty is lower than the amount written on a share, only the negative form pays, the positive one disappears.
If the difficulty is above the amount written on the a share, then only the positive form pays, the negative one disappears.

Owning these shares is a way to hedge against fluctuations in the price of the token.
Looking at the market for shares is a way to predict where the price of the token is going.
