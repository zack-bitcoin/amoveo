accounts and channels are things that live on the blockchain.


Keeping an account or channel on the blockchain costs a small fee for every block that they exist.


An account can store AE tokens, and any number of different kinds of shares. Accounts can store any number of different kinds of oracle bets.

oracle bets are not transferable. When their oracle settles, they can be transformed into shares with an oracle_shares transaction.

Channels can only store AE tokens, but when a channel settles those AE tokens can be split apart into equal amounts of positive and negative forms of the same types of shares.
