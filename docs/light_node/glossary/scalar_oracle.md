Scalar Oracle
===========

An oracle is an on-chain mechanism designed to get users to accurately report information to the blokchain.
A scalar oracle is for when the blockchain wants to find out a numerical value.

If you want to make a stablecoin that stays the same value as the Euro, you will need to connect the stablecoin contract to a scalar oracle that is measuring the price of the Euro in Veo. That way the contract will know how to distribute the Veo to correctly enforce a stablecoin contract.

Here is a page where you can ask the oracle new questions http://159.89.87.58:8080/new_oracle.html
