Comparing Amoveo with Augur
=============


Augur's oracle has a limit. The total amount of money at stake in betting needs to be significantly less than the total value of Rep.
With Augur's design, Rep needs to always be worth 7x more than the total money in all the bets, so on average Rep will be worth around 14x more than outstanding interest. Assuming around a 15% interest rate in cryptocurrency investments, annually fees on bets will be 14*15 = 210%, and for a month fees will be 6%


In Amoveo, we have solved this limit in the oracle problem that Augur suffers. Amoveo's oracle can support any amount of betting, and we have zero fees for P2P betting. Fees for market approach zero, because the cost of running a market is a small flat cost of renting a server, no matter how many people want to participate. Anyone can run a market.

Low volume markets, or markets where you can't stay online much time to optimize the channel path can be more expensive. In the worse case, the fee is the interest rate of the amount of money that you are betting. Which we earlier assumed is 15%.
15% is Amoveo's worst case annual fees, it is less than 1/10th as expensive Augur's average case annual fees of 210%.

Amoveo allows anyone to ask the oracle questions, which gives us more things to bet on. You can do it from this browser interface http://159.89.87.58:8080/new_oracle.html
