Website Security
========


Currently the tools for maintaining security of a website are difficulty to understand, and centrally controlled.

Blockchain technology allows for micro-payments, a simple to understand decentralized solution to give security to your website.

Micro-payments can prevent spam, because the profit from the fees will exceed the cost of handling the spam.

Micro-payments can prevent sybil attacks, (which are attacks where one person pretends to be many people) because each account has to have it's own money. You can't use the same money twice.

Today there is a battle between website designers and the spammers who find exploits to profit off of the website unfairly.
The tools to fight effectively are constantly changing. This makes it difficult for anyone to know if a website is secure.

Blockchain turns a complicated computer systems problem into a simple economic problem.

To show how this is possible with Amoveo, I made a website where you can make anonymous posts by paying a fee in VEO.
Like a 4chan where you have to pay to post.

I have similarly built an escrow tool.
