It was originally called a "dominant assurance contract".
This is a contract made for raising money for public goods. It is not like an ICO, no new subcurrency is created.

There are 2 popular ways to raise money for public goods today:
1) donation
2) taxation

The problem with donation is called a "free rider problem".
Some people who benefit from the public good's existence will refuse to donate.

The problem with taxation is that it involves the threat of violence.
Since violence is involved, some people will end up paying more for the good than how much it benefits them.

With insured crowdfunding each person ends up paying slightly less for the public good than how much it benefits them, this is the ideal we want.

There are 3 participants in insured crowdfunding:
1) Entreprenuers
2) Investors
3) Builders

There are 2 possible results of the crowdfund:
1) either the public good is successfully created,
2) or it is not

Here is a chart showing how much cost and reward each participant can get in each situation.

| Participants  | Entrepreneurs | Investors  | Builders |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Cost to play  | 10  | 110  | 0  |
| Success  | 20  | 0  | 100  |
| Failure  | 0  | 120  | 0  |

The entrepreneur's job is to do the research to realize that the benefit of the public good outweighs the cost. If the entrepreneur is wrong, then they lose their money.

The investor is someone who personally benefits from the creation of the public good. For example, maybe the public good is a new road, and the investor owns a store next to the road. The new road makes the store more valuable.
The investor participates because it is a way to hedge his risks. The investor is buying insurance against the possibility that the road does not get built. Whether the road is built or not, the investor still profits.
If the road is built, then the investor's store is more valuable, a profit.
If the road is not built, then the investor gets their money back plus interest, a profit.

The builder only gets paid if they successfully build the public good.
