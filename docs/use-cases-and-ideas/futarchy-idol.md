Amoveo can be used to make decisions for entertainment businesses.

An example to get started: we could use Amoveo instead of judges to determine who gets to survive in a competition show.

The competitor who has the most positive influence on the profitability of the show is the one who should be kept.

We can use conditional prediction markets to determine who is profitable, and who should be eliminated.

This will give our viewers a feeling that the outcome is fair, and that they can get involved with determining the outcome.

It could be fun for gamblers too.
