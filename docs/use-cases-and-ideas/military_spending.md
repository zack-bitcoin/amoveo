Military Spending
===========

By some estimates, the world military expenditure in 2018 was $1.8 trillion.

Some people believe that surrounding ourselves with trillions of dollars of high tech weaponry is a cost effective way to maintain our security. Other people think that the production of these death machines is only making the world more dangerous.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a mechanism to compare different kinds of military investments, to find out how cost effective they are at maintaining security.

The mechanism is called "futarchy".

Futarchy
==========

Futarchy is a method for groups of people to find out which strategy would be most effective for achieving their goal.

There is a market for wheat. A side-effect of the market for wheat is that we can all know the price of wheat that would allow for optimal distribution.
If we use a price that is lower than the market price, then there will be a wheat shortage.
If we use a price that is higher than the market price, then there will be excess unused wheat.

Some people like to imagine an "invisible hand" that is created by the market, and guides us to find an equilibrium balance between supply and demand.
The market is aggregating information from everyone who is trading in it, so that we can find out the current market price.

There is a market for life insurance. A side-effect of the market for life insurance is that we can know the odds of various ways of dying.
If it costs $100 to buy $100 000 of life insurance coverage for a certain period of time, then you can know there is about a 1 in 1000 chance that you will die during that period of time.

With futarchy, we start with a question, like "If we maintain an additional 100 nuclear bombs, how does this impact the odds that one of our cities will suffer from a nuclear explosion?".
Then we design a market such that the price of that market answers our question.

Futarchy will allow us to find out which sort of military investments would be most effective for maintaining the security of our nations, cities, and families.

Manipulation
==========

There are strong financial incentives to manipulate the public opinion in regards to which kind of military investments will be effective at maintaining our safety.
The people who manufacture bombs want us to invest in bombs.
Farmers want us to invest in food security.
Biologists want us to invest in genetic modification and germ warfare.

Any solution to measure the relative effectiveness of different kinds of military investment needs to be secure against rich manipulators who would like to create a bias in our system.

Futarchy is the only known way for groups of humans to make decisions that is not vulnerable to manipulators. Any attempt at manipulating the futarchy process only serves to make the results more accurate. http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/biashelp.pdf
