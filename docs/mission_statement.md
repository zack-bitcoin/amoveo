# Why Amoveo

# Money

Without money it would be very difficult to buy things, because you probably don't have anything that the other person wants, so you can't pay.
Without money it would be hard to plan a retirement. Nothing you could buy will last as long as you will live.
Without money it is hard to have a job, because you have to keep renegotiating wages depending on what you are being paid in.
A world without money is very chaotic.

It is too dangerous to depend on a centralized institution to provide such a critical part of our survival.
The counterfeiters can't resist the allure of the money press.
When they print, they are robbing everyone, they are pushing us towards the chaotic money-free world.

When money flows from a centralized source like this, the resulting economy is filled with hierarchies and pyramids. Everyone is begging for handouts from the counterfeiters, the best strategy is to team together into centralized institutions, that way you can afford to lobby the counterfeiters.


# Markets for Derivatives and Insurance

Derivatives are a way to exchance money from one point in time for the value of something else at a different point in time.
These are the tools that allow us to take bigger risks, and efficiently and fairly share the rewards to protect everyone who participates.
They protect us from risk, so some individuals can participate in more profitable economic activities which would otherwise be too dangerous.

For example:
Derivatives and insurance are the key tool for helping subsistence farmers become cash crop farmers, which is an important economic step to end world poverty.
Without derivatives, a farmer who doesn't plant subsistence crops risks watching his children die the same year.
With derivatives, the farmer can grow more profitable cash crops, and his children are not at risk of starvation.
The more valuable cash crops gives the farmer and his family the opportunity to escape poverty.

This is a tool we need to thrive, and no one should have the power to take it away.
The governments can't resist the allure of restricting access to derivatives and insurance. They do this to give themselves and their friends an economic advantage.
The people with access can easily outcompete everyone else economically. Almost any business can be significantly improved with access to these financial tools.
Restricting access to these financial tools is part of how the elite maintain their control.

Markets for derivatives is how people communicate their needs to each other across time. If the price of wheat futures is high in 6 months, then farmers can know to plan their farming to provide more wheat in 6 months for when the people will need it. 

Sometimes governments outlaw some derivatives markets.
Derivatives markets are for communicating needs. When they are gone, people can no longer communicate their needs.
Without derivatives the farmer doesn't know how many vegetables to plant of each variety, because he doesn't know how many vegetables people will need.

Bribing governments to outlaw derivatives can be an effective strategy for traders. It makes the price of vegetables more volatile, so there are more money making opportunities for speculators.

Amoveo is being built to create a world where everyone has equal access to these life-sustaining tools: money and derivatives.
These tools are important in much the same way access to electricity, sanitation, or clean drinking water is important.
Without one of these basic necessities, survival becomes difficult and people start dying at younger ages.

That is why Amoveo considers access to good currency, and access to secure financial derivatives to be unalienable human rights. 

Amoveo is technology to permanently protect these basic financial human rights for everyone.
