30 May 2019
=====

On this date, for a period of about 22 blocks, all the nodes froze and would not mine new blocks.

Loss
=====

the block reward is 0.16, the difficulty was lower because of this, reducing the loss by about half. veo is around $80
```$(80* 22 * 0.16 / 2) = $141 ```

About $141 of hashpower was wasted because of my mistake, and I sincerely apologize to miners and mining pools who are paying this cost.

What happened
======


Our anti-counterfeit tool caused us to freeze temporarily, because it thought that counterfeiting might be happening.
Luckily there was no counterfeiting.

Occasionally freezing like this is worth the peace of mind that it is impossible to produce veo out of nothing.
If it breaks, it is far better to break by freezing instead of breaking by letting an attacker produce veo from nothing.
this happened because hard update 17 changed how we deal with channel data after a channel is closed. The counterfeit scan tool thought that the channel was still open and had valid veo.


How we will avoid this in the future
=======

1) we have already patched this error.

2) in the future when we modify tx types, we will take the time to verify that the anti-counterfeiting tool accepts the new format.


Warning
======

This failure should serve us as a warning.
Amoveo is very experimental software.
There is high probability that you will lose everything that you invest in this project.
Invest less than you can afford to lose.
