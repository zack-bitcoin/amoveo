I wrote [this game](http://146.185.142.103:8080/finance_game.html) to help make it more obvious how finance improves the world.

The financial system produces a lot of wealth.

To show how bad the misconceptions of finance are, here is a quote from someone on Hacker News

"The size of the financial sector swelled to about 9% of GDP in 2010 from around 5% in in 1980. Perhaps that is what the thread was referring to. Nearly doubling in size when finance doesn't produce anything real. They are a middleman...
We dont need a big financial sector to have a great economy; Its a brain drain. Smart people should be working on real world problems like diseases, automation, efficient cheaper construction, environmental remediation, etc. that improve the standard of living for society."

This couldn't be further from the truth. For many smart people, the financial sector is the most effective way to improve the world.
I have tried using math to explain these concepts, and few people can understand.
So this time I wrote [A game](http://146.185.142.103:8080/finance_game.html) to make the concepts more concrete.
