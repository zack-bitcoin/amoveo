"what is the minimum amount of Aeons to operate a node that makes profit?

Aeternity nodes can make a profit by facilitating off-chain payments or markets.

The maximum volume of trades in the market is limited by how much money you have. So for a big market like a presidential election, you would need to be a whale. For smaller specialized prediction markets, like making decisions for a company like Aeternity, you probably only need $2000 to run a market like that.

If your market is optimized to move the lightning-path that enforces trades to a shorter path, that will make it much easier to run these markets. You would need to lock up much less Aeons to run this type of market.

As for routing payments, customers will prefer to pay lower fees, so they will prefer to make channels with accounts that are connected to as many other accounts as possible, so that the lightning payments will stay as short as possible. So the richest node will make the most profit per customer.
The market will determine the minimum amount of money to have a profitable node.

There will also be off-line networks, for people who want to make payments in places that don't have internet. Like burning man. These networks will have more limited coverage, and you could probably make a profit off of a networking node even if it only had $100.


Aeternity nodes can make a profit by participating in the oracle mechanism.

Using a node to profit from the oracle mechanism has no lower limit.
Even $1 is enough. But your profit will be in proportion to your investment. Someone who participated with $1000 would earn profit 1000 times as quickly.
