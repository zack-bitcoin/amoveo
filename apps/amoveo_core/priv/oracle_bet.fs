helper 
%1 means that the oracle returned true
int 1 == if drop drop 
     %delay, nonce, amount
     %delay has to be 1 or 0. it is multiplied by a bigger number to possibly set the delay to 0.
     int 0 int 3 bet_amount @ else

%2 is false
drop int 2 == if drop drop 
     int 0 int 3 int 10000 bet_amount @ - else

% 3 means that the oracle decided that the question was a bad question to ask that does not have a clear binary answer.
drop int 3 == if drop drop 
     int 0 int 3 int 10000 MaxPrice @ - else

%0 means the oracle is still unresolved 
drop int 0 == if drop drop
     % fail else
     int 1 int 1 int 10000 MaxPrice @ - else
